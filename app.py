            On my Website I teach how one can grow his/her spirituality to higher levels by:
            - moving away from religion and focusing on what really matters.
            - healing body through feeding which in turn heals the mind.
            - making people understand the truth of what is going on in the world and this will set them free, as it is know "The truth shall set you free
            - linking people with similar informations and other great teachers, making them aware we are not alone.
